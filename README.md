## 📌 About Me
I'm a second-year student majoring in **Statistics: Data Analysis**, actively building my career in **business analysis**. I'm passionate about turning data into insights, optimizing processes, and creating clear technical documentation.

While I'm still on my learning journey, I focus on practical skills:  
✅ Writing technical specifications (GOST-style)  
✅ Building BPMN and UML diagrams  
✅ Working with SQL (MySQL, SQLite, MS SQL)  
✅ Python for data analysis (pandas, matplotlib, etc.)  
✅ Use case modeling and requirements gathering  

I’m currently preparing for my first professional roles in IT as a **Junior Business Analyst**, ideally in a remote format.
